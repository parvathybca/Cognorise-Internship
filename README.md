# Internship Tasks Repository - Cognorise Infotech

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my internship tasks at Cognorise Infotech. 
This repository contains a series of projects showcasing my skills in Python programming and user interface design. 
Below is a brief description of each task completed during my internship.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Calculator App

This project involves designing a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. 
The application prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation choice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). 
After performing the calculation, the result is displayed to the user. 
This task demonstrates fundamental programming skills and user interaction handling.

### Task 2: Password Generator

The password generator is a tool that creates strong and random passwords for users. 
This project aims to provide a secure way to generate passwords by allowing users to specify the desired length and complexity. 
The application uses a combination of random characters to produce the password and displays it on the screen. 
This task highlights proficiency in handling user input, randomization, and string manipulation in Python.

### Task 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

In this project, I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows users to play against the computer. 
The user selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly generates its choice. 
The game then determines the winner based on standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. 
The result is displayed to the user, and an optional feature tracks scores over multiple rounds. 
This task emphasizes game logic implementation, randomization, and user interface design.

### Task 6: Countdown Timer

The Countdown Timer project is a user-friendly application designed to count down from a specified time. 
Utilizing the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface and the `time` library for time-related functions, this project helps users set custom countdown durations. 
It is a versatile tool suitable for various tasks such as cooking, productivity sprints, or workout sessions. 
This task showcases the practical application of Python in creating interactive and functional desktop tools, enhancing skills in event handling and time management.
